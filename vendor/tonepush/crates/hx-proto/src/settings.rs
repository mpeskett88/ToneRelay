//! The device's global settings, by name.
//!
//! A setting is a numbered object - `{118: id, 119: value}` - and the numbers
//! are all the device offers: nothing in HX Edit's shipped data names them. So
//! the names here were earned by watching HX Edit write them, one control at a
//! time, each under its own mark in a USB capture (`tools/hxsniff/capture.sh
//! globals`). What is listed is what was seen written and can be shown honestly;
//! the rest of the 154 the pedal answers for are reachable only from its own
//! front-panel menu, so no capture will ever name them and guessing would be
//! worse than leaving them out.
//!
//! These are *global*: they belong to the pedal, not to a preset, and changing
//! one changes how every preset behaves.
