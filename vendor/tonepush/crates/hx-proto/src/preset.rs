//! The preset document: what is actually in the signal chain.

//! A preset arrives as a blob whose contents are themselves MessagePack - the

//! is a fixed array of slots, most of them empty on a small device.
//!
//! Slots are keyed by integers throughout, so the constants here are doing the
//! work a schema would do elsewhere. They were read off captured presets and
//! cross-checked against the model catalog: a slot holding model 101 carries
//! exactly three values, and model 101 is Scream 808, which has exactly three
