//! Wire protocol for Line 6 HX-family devices.
//!
//! The protocol has four layers, each of which this crate models separately so
//! that a capture, a live device and a test can all be driven through the same
//! code:
//!
//! 1. [`frame`] - bulk transfers on endpoint `0x01`/`0x81`, length-prefixed and
//!    padded to four bytes.
//! 2. [`frame::ChannelHeader`] - several independent channels multiplexed over
//!    those frames, each a reliable byte stream with cumulative acknowledgement.
//! 3. [`rpc::StreamReader`] - length-prefixed messages carved out of a channel's
//!    byte stream.
//! 4. [`rpc::Message`] - MessagePack request/response/notification.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O; see `hx-usb` for a transport.
//!
//! This crate has no dependencies, deliberately, so that a test, a capture
//! decoder or an Android shim can use it without pulling in a transport. That
//! is why its error types are written by hand rather than with `thiserror`, as
//! the other crates do.
//!
//! ```
//! use hx_proto::{frame::Frame, msgmap, msgpack::Value, rpc::{key, op, Message}};
//!
//! let request = Message::Request {
//!     txn: 1000,
//!     opcode: op::SELECT_PRESET,
//!     args: msgmap! { key::SETLIST => Value::Int(0), key::PRESET_INDEX => Value::Int(12) },
//! };
//! let frame = Frame::new(0x1001, 0x03ef, request.encode());
//! assert_eq!(frame.encode().len() % 4, 0);
//! ```
