//! Building a device document's slots from a `.hlx`, the direction that did
//! not exist.
//!
//! [`to_hlx`](crate::to_hlx) turns a preset into Line 6's symbolic JSON, and
//! [`inspect`](crate::inspect) reads that JSON into tone facts. Neither goes
//! back to a document the pedal will accept, which is why restoring a `.hxb`
//! natively and importing a `.hlx` faithfully were the same missing piece: both
//! need JSON to become bytes.
//!
//! A slot on the wire is
//!
//! ```text
//! {19: kind, 20: {24: {23: paired?, 25: model, 26: cab or -1},
//!                  9: engine class, 10: enabled,
//!                 11: {2: n, 3: n', 4: [values]},
//!                 12: {…the cab's values…}}}
//! ```
//!
//! and every field of it can be read off a `.hlx` except two - the engine class
//! and that second count `n'` - which is what [`Catalog::type_tag`] and
//! [`Catalog::value_count_2`] exist for. See PROTOCOL.md.
//!
//! **The pedal will not take what this produces.** Checked on hardware: a
//! document rebuilt from its own symbolic form, with a chain identical to the
//! original block for block and value for value, is written and read back
//! empty. A `.hlx` does not record how each number was encoded - the same 1.0
//! is an integer in one preset and a float in another - and the document
//! carries a table of byte offsets into itself, so the wrong tag width is fatal
//! rather than cosmetic. This is the same failure the parser's own notes
//! describe: re-encode a wide tag narrow and "the device reads the result as
//! empty".
//!
//! So this is for reading a `.hxb` into something inspectable, and for building
//! tones offline - not for restoring onto a pedal. Restoring goes through
//! `.hxbundle`, which keeps the device's own bytes and cannot lose their shape.
//!
//! This writes slots into an existing document rather than inventing one from
//! nothing. A preset carries a great deal besides its chain - a section table
//! of byte offsets into itself, snapshot state, footswitch assignments - and
//! the honest way to get those right is to start from a document the device
//! wrote and replace the part being described.
