//! Writing a `.hlx` preset from a device-free [`Preset`], the save half of the
//! reader in [`inspect`](crate::inspect).
//!
//! This is the exact inverse of the inspector. The inspector turns Line 6's
//! symbolic JSON into "what this tone is"; this turns a parsed preset back into
//! that same JSON, so a library can hold tones as `.hlx` files and read them
//! back with the piece it was saved by. Like the inspector it runs entirely
//! from the catalog and the preset, never the pedal.
//!
//! Three shapes are worth calling out, all read off a real HX Edit `.hlx`:
//!
//! * Blocks are keyed `block0`, `block1`, … densely and in chain order, with
//!   the endpoints and junctions living under their own keys rather than in the
//!   block run. We number the blocks we emit, so the numbering stays dense even
//!   when a model cannot be written.
//! * An amp and its cab are two separate blocks. On the wire a paired cab rides
//!   in the amp's slot, so we split it back out into its own block, right after
//!   the amp - the way a standalone amp and cab already appear in a file.
//! * `@model` is matched back by exact string, both here and on the apply path,
//!   which has no base-name fallback. So we write the precise firmware symbol
//!   the wire number resolves to - suffix and all - rather than the base name a
//!   real file pairs with `@stereo`. It is unambiguous and it is what both of
//!   our readers require to resolve it.
//!
//! Parameter values are written in their native units, the way the format
//! stores them - no display scaling - keyed by the parameter's symbolic id, and
//! a switch as a bool. That is the mirror image of how the inspector reads them
//! back.
