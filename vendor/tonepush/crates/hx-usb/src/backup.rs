//! A complete backup of a pedal, and putting one back.
//!
//! What a backup has to hold is everything the pedal would lose if it were
//! wiped: every preset, every global setting, every impulse response, and the
//! setlists they live in. That is what is captured here, and the reason it is
//! worth building rather than leaning on HX Edit's `.hxb` is that a `.hxb`
//! stores presets as HX Edit's own symbolic JSON - a conversion, and a
//! conversion is a thing that can be wrong. These are the pedal's own bytes.
//!
//! A bundle is a **directory**, not an archive:
//!
//! ```text
//! 2026-08-09 HX Stomp.hxbundle/
//!   manifest.json          what this is, when, and from which pedal
//!   presets/000 CT-Blackend.hxpreset      byte for byte as the device holds it
//!   presets/001 CT-Day CLN.hxpreset
//!   globals.json           every setting the device answers for, id to value
//!   irs/01 Fredman.f32     48 kHz mono f32 samples, as stored
//! ```
//!
//! Being a directory is the point. A half-written archive is a lost backup,
//! whereas a half-written directory has lost only the file it was writing; the
//! presets are ordinary files a person can read, copy, or hand back one at a
//! time without this program; and an incremental backup can rewrite one preset
//! rather than the whole thing. The manifest is JSON for the same reason.
