//! Recording a live session's raw byte transport, and replaying it offline.
//!
//! The command layer - every `set_model`, `read_preset`, handshake frame - can
//! only be exercised against hardware. That is a problem the day the hardware
//! is sold: nothing offline proves a refactor did not change the bytes a
//! command sends. So a session can run against a [`RecordingWire`] that logs
//! every transfer, and the log can be replayed through a [`ReplayWire`] with no
//! device present. The replay returns each recorded response in order *and*
//! checks that each request still matches what was recorded, so a command whose
//! encoding drifts fails offline, as a diff.
