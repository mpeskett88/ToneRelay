//! then asking the device whether it is still there can.
//!
//! They are `#[ignore]` because they need an HX device with HX Edit quit:
//!
//!     cargo test -p hx-usb -- --ignored --test-threads=1
//!
//! `--test-threads=1` is not optional. The device serves one session at a time,
//! and two tests talking at once is itself a way to wedge it.
//!
//! Every test ends by asserting the device is still healthy, so a failure tells
